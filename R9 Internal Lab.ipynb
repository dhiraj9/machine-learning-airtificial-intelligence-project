    "Rating predictions using reviews written by users can be a useful problem statement in E-commerce domain and can be used for recommending similar products that may interest users. The dataset in this problem statement comprises reviews pertaining to Samsung Internal SSD product specifically SAMSUNG 850 EVO 2.5\" 250GB SATA III 3D NAND Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) MZ-75E250B/AM from the NewEgg Store website.
